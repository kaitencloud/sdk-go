# Contributing to Kaiten SDK for Go

Thank you for contributing to the Kaiten Go SDK.

This project is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

Kaiten uses the Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO) for contributions.

Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` trailer matching the commit author.

Use:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Describe your change"
```

This produces:

```text
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
```

`git commit -s` is a **DCO sign-off**: it certifies the contribution under
[DCO.md](./DCO.md). `git commit -S`, with a capital S, is a **cryptographic
commit signature** made with a GPG or SSH key. They are not the same thing, and
the sign-off is what this project requires. There is nothing to install.

### Fixing a missing sign-off

A check named **DCO** verifies every commit of every pull request, and it is the
final word. If it fails, it names the commits to fix.

For the latest commit:

```bash
git commit --amend --signoff --no-edit
git push --force-with-lease
```

For several commits, sign off every commit of your branch at once:

```bash
git rebase --signoff origin/main
git push --force-with-lease
```
